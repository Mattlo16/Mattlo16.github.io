In June 2022, I embarked on a Unity project driven by my passion for game development. Through self-teaching, I acquired skills in Unity Engine and C# scripting, culminating in the creation of a 2D side-scroller game named Spaghetti. This game involved overcoming obstacles to collect seven different Spaghettis, coded in C# and hosted on GitHub for web-based access, igniting my enthusiasm for integrating coding with other applications and reaffirming my dedication to game development.
